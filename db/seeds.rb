# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Users:
  # tomp = User.create(
  #   first_name: 'Tom',
  #   last_name: 'Pastorello',
  #   email: 'tompastorello@gmail.com',
  # )

# Sections: Do 1x
# food = Section.create(

# garden = Section.create(
